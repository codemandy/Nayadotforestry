Naya is a choreographer, dancer and dramaturge. She holds a BA in dance and choreography from The Danish National School of Performing Arts, where she graduated in 2017. Both as a choreographer and as a dramaturge her work is embedded in phenomenology as well as feminist critique, emerging in questions relating to the phenomenology of senses, the body and its interrelation to the outer world/nature. In her landscape performances for dance and music made site specifically to hospices in Denmark, she is investigating choreography in relation to landscapes, with care as a recurring theme. Care also refers to how she works with the relation to the audicence, in how she produces works, and in her leadership.

As a dramaturge, Naya is working closely together with the choreographer Emilie Gregersen, and have been a part of the unfolding of a performance trilogy about the phenomenology of senses, first with Touch (2020), then Caresses (2021).

Naya has worked as a performer for artists such as Marina Abramovic, Lilibeth Cuenca Rasmussen, and currently with Nana Francisca Schottländer.

Naya is a part of Dance Cooperative in Copenhagen, a self-organized collective space for performance and intersectional practices. She is board member of DANSEatelier, and board member and editor of “Kvinde Kend Din Krop“, a fund working with public health information about the body, gender, sex and culture.

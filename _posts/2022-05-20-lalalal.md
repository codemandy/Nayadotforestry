  The piece touch is generated from an interest in the phenomena of touch – the
  tactile sense that allows us to be in relation. It arises as a
  phenomenological and poetic reflection of touch as a fundamental condition of
  being in the world. The performance offers a scenic contemplation of tactility
  and how touch plays a role in the way we engage with the world.

  – Naya Moll

ouch is a choreographic piece by Emilie Gregersen. The piece is developed in collaboration with sound artist Karis Zidore and dramaturge/choreographic consultant Naya Moll. The work studies the perception of touch in a mutual influence and reflection between the digital and the physical world. Touch is being stretched on the scales of intimacy and distance, reality and fiction, human and human-like. In the collision between something deeply heartfelt and something extremely mechanical, an absurd and ironic drama arises, where human perceptions of touch are being distorted in a metallic and tech-sensual universe.

The piece touch is generated from an interest in the phenomena of touch – the tactile sense that allows us to be in relation. It arises as a phenomenological and poetic reflection of touch as a fundamental condition of being in the world. The performance offers a scenic contemplation of tactility and how touch plays a role in the way we engage with the world.

_touch_ is a choreographic piece by Emilie Gregersen. The piece is developed in collaboration with dramaturge and choreographic consultant Naya Moll and sound artist Karis Zidore.

The work studies the perception of touch in a mutual influence and reflection between the digital and the physical world. Touch is being stretched on the scales of intimacy and distance, reality and fiction, human and human-like. In the collision between something deeply heartfelt and something extremely mechanical, an absurd and ironic drama arises, where human perceptions of touch are being distorted in a metallic and tech-sensual universe.

_The piece_ touch _is generated from an interest in the phenomena of touch – the tactile sense that allows us to be in relation. It arises as a phenomenological and poetic reflection of touch as a fundamental condition of being in the world. The performance offers a scenic contemplation of tactility and how touch plays a role in the way we engage with the world._ <br>-Naya Moll

As a companion to the performance, Naya Moll has written the piece _the hand the eye_ as a textual sibling. _the hand the eye_ has also been issued in This Container Magazine.
